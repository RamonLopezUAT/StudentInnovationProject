### Project Description
**Meta Insight** is a program that makes metadata analysis accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise. Users can upload files to view detailed metadata, with explanations that help them understand key metadata categories. They can also export metadata to a text file or create a copy of the file without metadata. This tool brings a professional cybersecurity function to a broader audience, empowering individuals to enhance their digital safety.

### Why It Was Built
Meta Insight was developed to address the growing need for privacy awareness and digital safety among users of all technical levels. Metadata can contain sensitive information, and while many cybersecurity professionals use metadata tools, few are accessible to the average person. Meta Insight solves this by providing a simple, educational, and accessible way for users to interact with and manage their metadata, helping them gain control over their digital footprint.

### Required Software
- **Python 3.8 or higher**: Meta Insight is built using Python, so a compatible version is necessary.
- **Tkinter**: A standard GUI toolkit for Python, typically included with Python installations.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image metadata extraction. Install via `pip install pillow`.

### Installation Instructions
1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python 3.8 or higher from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Download Meta Insight**: Download the repository from GitHub: https://github.com/RamonLopezUAT/StudentInnovationProject
3. **Run the Program**: Navigate to the project directory and run the main application file:
    a. Navigate where you saved Meta Insight, look for a 'main.py' file.
    b. On the **address bar**, this shows you where you currently are.
       i. Click on it,
       ii. Type in `cmd`,
       iii. Press enter.
    c. Command prompt will open with the directory you are currently in,
       i. Type in `py main.py`,
       ii. Press enter.
       iii. **(If Required)**, Install required dependencies using `pip install **[dependency]**`.
       iv. Repeat step ci.

### How to Use Meta Insight
1. **Start the Application**: Launch the program by running `main.py`.
2. **Upload a File**: Drag and drop a file onto the interface or use the “Select File” button to upload.
3. **View Metadata**: Once uploaded, the file’s metadata will be displayed, with explanations for each category.
4. **Export Metadata (Optional)**: Use the export option to save the metadata to a text file for easy reference.
5. **Create Metadata-Free Copy (Optional)**: Use the “Wipe Metadata” button to create a copy of the file with metadata removed, helping enhance privacy.
